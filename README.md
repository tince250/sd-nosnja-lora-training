# Fine-tuning Stable Diffusion with LoRA

Applying the `LoRA method` of fine-tuning the `Stable Diffusion v1.5` as the base model, on the task of learning to generate `Serbian traditional clothing` ("narodna nosnja").

During training with different hyperparameter tunning, dataset, and label tweaks, 3 successful versions of clothing "narodna nosnja" LoRAs were chosen:
- v1
- v2
- v3

All three give satisfactory results and can generate images of girls wearing traditional Serbian clothing with high accuracy and generalization ability.

The repository contains:
- `FineTuneStableDiffusionNosnjaPoster.pdf` - research poster for the project 
- `Srpska_Nosnja_LoRA_SD_fine_tuning.ipynb` - notebook used for fine-tuning Stable Diffusion with LoRA, adapted from Kohyaa's scripts
- `dataset/` - folder containing images used for training
- `labels/` - folder containing labels used for training
- `lora files/` - folder containing the produced LoRA safetensors files
- `demo images/` - folder containing representative results generated by different Stable Diffusion models and produced LoRAs
- `tests` - XYZ plots used for verification and investigation of results across different checkpoints and hyperparameter configurations
